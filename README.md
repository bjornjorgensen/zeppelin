    No need to install or maintain Zeppelin to keep it up-to-dated.

    Markdown, Shell, Spark, Python, JDBC interpreters are included

- Kubernetes mode (== Scalable)

    Zeppelin on Kubernetes is enabled by default. Each interpreter runs on their own container.

- Zero maintenance Spark Cluster

    It configures Spark on Kubernetes out of the box.
    That means you don't need to configure, manage Spark cluster. Instead, just give number of executors you want in the notebook and enjoy distributed computing without headache.


    ```
    %spark.conf
    spark.executor.instances 3

    %spark
    // run spark API. 3 instances of worker will be automatically created
    ```

### Run locally with prebuilt image

It takes 30~40 minutes to build all images while Zeppelin requires long time to build.
`prebuilt` profile is included in skaffold.yaml so changes doesn't necessary to re-build Zeppelin can be tested quickly in local minikube environment.

```
skaffold dev -f .staroid/skaffold.yaml -p prebuilt,minikube --port-forward
```
